# Book List Client
#### Team FUBAR-at-theFooBar
##### Joy Hou & Nicholas Carignan

Project for Code 301, Week 3
Version 4.0

## Overview
This application tracks books that we want to read or have read. It pulls the initial book data from a JSON file or we can populate it in manually to an API with a database containing the book information. The client side displays the list of books, and the user can add a new book. With the admin password, the user can also update or delete a book. This is a single page application utilizing pageJS and AJAX.

## Getting Started
You would need to create the HTML and CSS for each 'page', create a server and install dependencies, create the database, link everything together, and write all functions and code to create the working app. You will also need to deploy to Heroku and gh-pages.

## Architecture
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL.
Libraries: highlight.pack.js, marked.js, JQuery, Express, Postgres, Bodyparser, Handlebars, icoMoon, NodeJS, cors, pageJS
